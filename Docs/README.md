Here you will find documents describing Hopac.

* [Programming in Hopac](Programming.md) contains some discussion and examples
  on Hopac programming techniques.  In the future, this document might grow to a
  proper introduction to Hopac.
* [Actors and Hopac](Actors.md) discusses the similaries and differences between
  actor models and the programming model provided by Hopac.
* [Parallel Programming Performance Considerations](Performance.md) discusses
  fundamental issues that affect the performance of parallel algorithms on
  shared memory multiprocessors and how those issues translate into practical
  design patterns.
* [Hopac Library Reference](http://vesakarvonen.github.io/Hopac/Hopac.html)
  manual is generated from the Hopac library source code.
* [Hopac.Extra Library Reference](http://vesakarvonen.github.io/Hopac/Hopac.Extra.html)
  manual is generated from the Hopac.Extra library source code.
* [Notes on the Internal Implementation of Hopac](Internals.md) describes some
  aspects of the internal implementation of Hopac.  This document is not meant
  to be something that a user of Hopac would need to understand, but potential
  users might find this interesting nevertheless.
