#### 0.3.18 - 2016-09-xx
* Changed the specification of and optimized `*<+->-` and `*<+=>-` with respect
  to exception handling.  This is technically a breaking change, but it is
  unlikely and unadvised that one would be raising exception within them.

#### 0.3.17 - 2016-09-12
* Eliminated undefined behaviour from `MVar.fill`, `IVar.fill` and
  `IVar.fillFailure`.

#### 0.3.16 - 2016-09-12
* Fixed dependencies in nupkg.

#### 0.3.15 - 2016-09-10
* Added preliminary .NET Core support.  Big thanks to @haf, @ncave and
  @enricosada!

#### 0.3.14 - 2016-09-07
* Added an optimized applicative combinator `Job.apply`.

#### 0.3.13 - 2016-08-24
* Added stack to deadlock warning (thanks to Michael Newton).

#### 0.3.12 - 2016-08-21
* Optimized `MVar.read`, `MVar.mutateFun`, `MVar.modifyFun`, `MVar.tryMutateFun`
  and `MVar.tryModifyFun`.

#### 0.3.11 - 2016-08-20
* Added `MVar.mutateFun`, `MVar.mutateJob`, `MVar.tryMutateFun`,
  `MVar.tryMutateJob`, `MVar.tryModifyFun`, and `MVar.tryModifyJob`.

#### 0.3.10 - 2016-08-16
* Changed interop primitives to avoid building up stack space in case interop
  resumes synchronously on a worker thread.

#### 0.3.9 - 2016-08-14
* `JobBuilder.Delay` was changed to be the identity function,
* `JobBuilder.Run` was introduced to perform `Job.delay`,
* `EmbeddedJobBuilder.Run` was also changed to take a `unit -> Job<_>`,
* `JobBuilder.Combine`, `JobBuilder.TryFinally`, `JobBuilder.TryWith` and
  `JobBuilder.While` now take a `unit -> Job<_>` rather than a `Job<_>`.

These potentially breaking changes make it so that the `... ; ...`,
`try-finally`, `try-with` and `while` constructs of `job` avoid a separate
`Job.delay` wrapper and perform better.

#### 0.3.8 - 2016-08-13
* Added `Stream.mapPipelinedFun` and `Stream.mapPipelinedJob`.
* Added `Job.liftTask` and `Job.liftUnitTask`.

#### 0.3.7 - 2016-08-08
* Added `Job.useIn`, a flipped version of `Job.using`, and optimized both.

#### 0.3.6 - 2016-08-06
* Added `Job.fromContinuations`.

#### 0.3.5 - 2016-08-06
* Faster `Job.fromAsync`.
* Added `Job.bindAsync`.

#### 0.3.4 - 2016-08-05
* Fixed `FSharp.Core ~> 3` dependency once again. :(

#### 0.3.3 - 2016-08-05
* Added `Hopac.startAsTask` and `Hopac.queueAsTask` for interop with tasks.

#### 0.3.2 - 2016-08-04
* Added `Job.toAsync` and marked `Async.ofJobOn` and `Async.Global.ofJob` as
  obsolete.
* Added `Alt.toAsync`.
* Renamed the `TopLevel` module to `Hopac`.  This rename is part of eliminating
  the scheduler concept and was made so that one can refer to e.g `Hopac.run`
  making it obvious where the functionality is coming from.
* Marked the `Job.Global` module as obsolete.  The `Hopac` module is the new
  home for the same functionality.
* Marked `Job.startWithFinalizer` as obsolete.  Use the `Proc` abstraction
  instead.
* Marked the `Timer` module for removal.  Use the `Hopac` module.
* Moved `Ch.Global.send -> Ch.Now.send` and `Mailbox.Global.send ->
  Mailbox.Now.send`.  This is part of eliminating the scheduler concept.
* Marked `*.create` functions obsolete where a constructor will do the job.
  Originally constructors were treated quite differently from other functions in
  F#.  Today the differences are smaller and not enough to justify duplication.

#### 0.3.1 - 2016-07-30
* Marked `Async.toJobOn` and `Async.toAltOn` as obsolete.

#### 0.3.0 - 2016-07-28
* Introduced new optimized primitives for `Task`, `Async` and `Begin-End`
  interop (see reference), obsoleting interop primitives `Async.toJob`,
  `Async.toAlt`, `Task.awaitJob`, and `Task.bindJob`.
* Deprecated `JobBuilder.Bind` and `JobBuilder.ReturnFrom` overloads with
  non-generic `Task` as argument, because they cause type-inference problems.

#### 0.2.1 - 2016-06-05
* Improved structure and formatting of the reference manual.
* Changed internal stack limit setting mechanism for trampolining.
* Potentially breaking change: `Stream.Builder.Plus` method was renamed into
  `Stream.Builder.Combine`.
* Added `Stream.tryPickJob` and `Stream.tryPickFun`.
* Fixed `Job.using` to not raise in case given disposable reference is `null`.

#### 0.2.0 - 2016-06-01
* Dropped obsolete definitions.
* Exception handling fixes to `<*>`.
* Allow null in `Job.using` for the disposable.
* Fixed `Stream.Src` ops to be atomic.
* Added various missing operators for symmetry.
* Added `IVar.tryFillFailure`.

#### 0.1.4 - 2016-05-09
* New package Hopac-StrongName for those requiring it.

#### 0.1.3 - 2015-12-15

* Reverted `FSharp.Core` dependency.

#### 0.1.2 - 2015-11-27
* Fixed lack of tail call workaround in `for` and `while`.

#### 0.1.1 - 2015-11-23
* XML documentation was missing from `0.1.0`.
* Updated `FSharp.Core` dependency to `4.0.0.1`.
* Redesigned infix operator symbols to allow most common expressions to be
  written without parentheses and also added several new infix operators.  See
  the documentation for details.
* Moved all infix operators to the `Hopac.Infixes` module so that one only has
  to open one module to use infix operators.
* Introduced `Alt.prepare*` and `Alt.after*` combinators for clarity and
  uniformity to replace `delay`, `guard` and `wrap`.
* Added `Job.isolate` as a workaround for scheduling issues.
* Minor additions: `Seq.foldFromJob`, `Proc.bind`, `Proc.map`.

#### 0.1.0 - 2015-11-23
* Redesigned infix operator symbols to allow most common expressions to be
  written without parentheses and also added several new infix operators.  See
  the documentation for details.
* Moved all infix operators to the `Hopac.Infixes` module so that one only has
  to open one module to use infix operators.
* Introduced `Alt.prepare*` and `Alt.after*` combinators for clarity and
  uniformity to replace `delay`, `guard` and `wrap`.
* Added `Job.isolate` as a workaround for scheduling issues.
* Minor additions: `Seq.foldFromJob`, `Proc.bind`, `Proc.map`.

  `Stream.appendAll`, `Stream.mergeAll` and `Stream.switchAll`
* Fixed to start reading the serialized variable immediately as documented.
* Added `Stream.subscribe*` as a shorthand for `Stream.iter* |> queue`.
* Added mutable `Stream.Property<'x>` that generates property change
  notifications for e.g. WPF data binding.
* Added `doFinalizeJob` and `doFinalizeFun`.
* Experimental wrapper for streams that tracks space safety via phantom types.
* Changed `groupByJob` and `groupByFun` to take an additional function/job for
  forming new groups.
* Added `Stream.tailsMapFun` and `Stream.initsMapFun` these are useful for
  lifting the `Stream.tails` and `Stream.inits` functions.
* Added `keepFollowing1` and renamed `keepLatest` to `keepPreceding` to make the
  naming more symmetric although the concepts of "following" and "preceding"
  aren't really fully symmetric (unless you allow time travel).
* A slightly more performant implementation of `keepLatestFuns`.
* Renamed from `lazify` to `keepLatest`.
* Lazification of live streams.
* Rethinking timing and throttling operations.
* Generalized `joinWith` and `mapJoin`.
* There is no sleep, only `timeOut`.

* Removed superfluous methods from `Async.OnWithSchedulerBuilder`.

#### 0.0.0.44 - 2015-03-02

  signalled.

* Added `Job.tryFinallyFunDelay`, `Job.tryFinallyJobDelay`, `Job.tryWithDelay`
  and `Job.whileDoDelay`.
* Added `Stream.mapConst`.
* Removed `Stream.subscribeOnFirst`, `Stream.subscribeDuring` and
  `Stream.subscribingTo`, because `Stream.ofObservable` easily covers all of
  those use cases.

* Scale work sharing by the number of cores.

* Added `Alt.wrapAbortFun`.
* Added `Alt.choosy`, which is an optimized version of `Alt.choose` for arrays.
* Added `Job.Scheduler.bind` for wrapping external asynchronous events.
* Added `Alt.withNackFun`.
* Inlineable `withNack` avoids closure allocation.
* Added experimental support for running async comptations on the main
  synchronization context, which must be explicitly configured by application
  code.
* Added `IObservable<'x>.onceAltOn` extension method for conveniently
  interfacing Hopac with suitable observables.
* Added `TopLevel.startDelay` and `TopLevel.queueDelay` for convenience.

* Added `TopLevel.memo` as an alias for `Promise.Now.delay`.
* Added `Stream.takeAndSkipUntil`.
* Disable inlining of `Latch.Now.create` as an attempt to work around a
  `MissingMethodException`.

* Renamed `Stream.switchOn` to `Stream.switchTo`.
